"""Handle Telegram chat lifecycle events for the bot.

Three relevant Telegram update types:

  my_chat_member — the bot's own membership in a chat changed (added, removed,
    promoted, demoted). This is how we know to register a new chat or pause an
    existing one.

  chat_member    — another user's membership in a chat changed. We only care
    about this to keep chat_members in sync when people leave/join the group,
    so admins-only commands don't accidentally include or exclude the wrong
    people. To receive chat_member updates the bot must be an admin AND the
    update type must be enabled in allowed_updates — see main.py.

  message with migrate_from_chat_id — the chat was converted from a regular
    group to a supergroup. Telegram assigns the supergroup a new chat_id, so
    we re-key all data from the old id to the new one. See on_chat_migrate.
