"""DM members (and the people who added guests) whenever a participant's
registration changes by someone other than themselves.

The public entry point is `diff_and_notify(...)`, which takes a
before/after snapshot of the participants for a game, diffs them, and
sends one DM per affected user. The actor's own changes are skipped —
the person who just tapped Leave / Join / Confirm in the mini-app
doesn't need a DM about what they themselves just did. Same idea for
guests: only the *adder* gets DM'd, and only when the change came from
somebody else (admin removed their guest, waitlist auto-promoted their
guest, etc.).

We match participants across the two snapshots by *identity*, not by
participant_id. That matters for moves implemented as remove + re-add
(e.g. confirmed → maybe goes through `remove_participant` + `add_maybe`,
which mints a new participant row). Matching by member_id keeps that
case a single "status changed" DM instead of two separate
"removed" + "added" DMs. For guests the identity is (adder, name) —
not perfect if one member adds two guests with the same name, but
that's a rare collision and the worst outcome is one wrongly-suppressed
DM, not data corruption.

All DMs are best-effort. If a recipient has never DM'd the bot we get
a 403 from Telegram; we swallow and log at INFO. The chat-card refresh
remains the canonical record of state for everyone who didn't get the
DM.
