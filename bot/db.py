"""SQLite layer.

We use sqlite3 directly (no ORM) — the schema is small enough that an ORM
adds more noise than value. All functions are thin wrappers that return
plain dicts or lists.

Concurrency note: python-telegram-bot dispatches handlers on a single
asyncio loop, so we don't need a connection pool. We open one connection
at startup and use it for everything; SQLite serializes writes internally.
